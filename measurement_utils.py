    # and potentially anthropometric knowledge.
    # 1. Calibrate coordinate systems and scale using known height.
    # 2. Combine 3D landmarks and depth information from both views.
    # 3. Identify key body points (shoulders, chest, waist, hips, etc.).
    # 4. Calculate distances and circumferences based on these points.
    #    - Circumferences might involve fitting ellipses/cylinders to point clouds
    #      derived from landmarks and depth around the relevant body part.
    #    - Widths/lengths can be direct distances between landmarks.
    # 5. Use gender and potentially weight to refine estimates or select algorithms.
