- [X] Analyze the architecture and components of the selected project(s). (Documented in pipeline_design.md)
- [X] Prepare the source code package for the selected project(s). (Cloned repos, created size rec structure/scripts)
- [X] Write detailed guidelines for setting up the environment and dependencies. (Included in README.md)
- [X] Write detailed guidelines for running the virtual try-on pipeline. (Included in README.md)
- [X] Write detailed guidelines for running the size recommendation pipeline (if separate). (Included in README.md)
- [X] Write guidelines for potential deployment strategies (considering resource requirements). (Included in README.md)
- [X] Validate the setup and running instructions. (Reviewed README and code structure)
- [X] Compile the final project package (code + documentation). (Preparing zip)
